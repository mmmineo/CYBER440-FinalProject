### Data Description BLUF

The client provided our team with ~4 days of network traffic data, 8 disk images, 7 memory dumps, and about 90,000 log events. All of this data resides within the client's LAN.

Network analysis shows large amounts of traffic travelling between the assumed Domain Controller at 192.168.100.10 and all other hosts on the network.

Disk image analysis shows large amounts of PII on the network's shared drive.

Memory dump analysis shows _possibly malicious processes_

Log analysis shows purely IMAP mail traffic travelling between 192.168.100.21 (mail server?) and other hosts.

### Network Data
1. How many months/weeks/days/hours/minutes worth of network data do you have? **4 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes and 55 seconds**
2. How many packets? **12,315,047** _Note: "Killed" exception thrown on 02-27-2020_1.4 that may have affected total packet count._

```
def logcount():
    count = 0
    for file in filenames:
        with open(file) as currentcsv:
            csvreader = csv.reader(currentcsv)

3. Describe the types of log entries you have -- what systems generated the log entries? **IMAP Mail Server**
4. Describe the log file aggregator - **ELK Logging is a Linux-based aggregator**
5. Identify any initial findings
  - **GET/SENT for hundreds of UID flags**
  - **All traffic sourcing from .21? _Need to confirm_**

### Indicators of Compromise
  - **_Unknown_**

### Questions and Concerns
1. Identify any questions you have for the client
  - Many of the disk images have the standard Administrator account, but they also have admin and administrator, which are manually created accounts. Why?
  - What is the naming scheme? Are Mayor1_3 and Mayor1_4 two different snapshots of the same machine or are they two completely different machines? If the latter, why is there a Mayor2_x?
2. Identify any concerns or issues that your team has
